# GameOfLifeAndroid
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life for Android. It can display some basic patterns and one can "revive" cells
by clicking on them. Living cells have the color magenta, dead cells are black.

## Basic usage
On startup, the board will be randomly populated with (quite a lot of) living cells. You can hit the play button and the
simulation starts. On the bottom left corner, the current generation of the simulation is being displayed.

Features:
- start/stop the simulation at any given time
- repopulate the simulation whenever you want
- choose a pattern
- set the speed of the simulation with the slider
- "revive" cells by clicking on them

## Patterns
Currently you can choose from 8 different patterns. Some of them are moving, some of them are endless and some just last for a
couple of generations.

## Reviving cells
You can revive cells by just clicking on them. The best thing to do is to pause the simulation so you can take your time.
Otherwise you have to be really fast to see an effect. (Like really, really fast.)

## Final notes
If you have any suggestions to make the app better, feel free to open an issue. Of course you can also make a pull request
after you've changed something.

I hope you enjoy it!
